# Hello!

My name is Carolyn Knapp I am in my last stretch at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, working towards a bachelor's degree in computer science that I'll complete in December 2024. As a woman carving out my space in tech, I've kept up a strong GPA of 3.79, which keeps me on the Dean's List and shows how serious I am about my studies.

Throughout my academic journey, I've gotten good at programming with languages like C++, Java, and Python, and I can handle web stuff like HTML, CSS and Javascript, too. I'm also pretty familiar with Microsoft Office and Access, as well as operating systems like Windows 10 & 11.

Before I got really into the tech world, I worked in office jobs where I picked up a bunch of skills in organizing, figuring things out, and talking to people. These jobs made me pretty good at handling different kinds of work situations.

I'm ready to use all I've learned to do something big in the world of computer science. I'm excited about getting out there, trying new things, and growing more in the tech field. I want to be part of the change and show what women can do in tech.
