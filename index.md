# Hello!

My name is Carolyn Knapp. I am currently a student at University of Missouri-Kansas City, pursuing my first bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science. I expect to graduate in December 2024. With a passion for technology and an impressive GPA of 3.79, I have consistently made the Dean's List, demonstrating my commitment to academic excellence.

Throughout my academic journey, I've developed a skill set in programming languages such as C++, Java, and Python, alongside web technologies like CSS and HTML. My proficiency also extends to software and databases, including Microsoft Office Suite and Access, coupled with a deep understanding of operating systems like Windows 10 & 11.

Before immersing myself in the tech world, I obtained valuable administrative experience as an Executive Assistant/Bookkeeper at Journey to New Life, Inc., and as a Plan Administrator at MedTrak Services, LLC. These roles honed my organizational, problem-solving, and communication skills, making me adept at navigating professional environments.

My ambition is to utilize my varied background and technical skills to effect meaningful change in the field of computer science. As I further my journey, gaining knowledge and experience, I eagerly anticipate opportunities that not only test my abilities but also foster my personal and professional growth within the tech industry.
