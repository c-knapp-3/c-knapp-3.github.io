# Education Background

Ever since I got my hands on a Commodore 64 as a child, I've loved all things tech. I attended high school at St. Teresa's Academy in Kansas City, MO. My time there was filled with a mix of sports like basketball and volleyball and brainy stuff like AP algebra and chemistry, and I finished strong with a 3.8 GPA.

I started my college journey in Portland, OR, studying psychology, then switched gears to accounting in Chicago. But about four years back, it all clicked: computer science was my thing. I achieved my associates degree at Metropolitan Community College, getting most of my core classes out of the way.

In 2022, I enrolled at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, fully committed to pursuing a major in computer science. I remain dedicated to my studies and am eagerly anticipating my graduation this December. I'm super excited to put everything I've learned to work and start my tech career, hopefully as a full-stack software developer. It's been a long journey with lots of twists and turns, but every step has been preparing me for a future in tech.
